## CSCE 315 Final Project

## Description
-   this Application allows a user to give some suggestions for activities to do a home while in quarantine
  where this is based on users' behaviors and mood at the current time. Where it also allows the user to explore different
  types of activities offered in the Application.

## Usage & Requirements
- You will need a working installation of the latest version of Python 3, 
- Clone the repo to a directory of your choice. 
#### Only do these 2 steps if you want to use a virtual environment
1. On Windows, execute the `activate.bat` script located in the `venv/bin` folder. The full path, then, is `Project_2\venv\bin\activate.bat`
2. On Linux, use the `source` command. `cd` to the repo's root directory. Then run in a terminal `source ./venv/bin/activate`


- Now, type in `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. The necessary modules will now install
- On Linux terminal, or Windows powershell, execute in a terminal in the folder containing the repo run `python wsgi.py`. and this will start the server.
- Finally, to view our prototype, go to `127.0.0.1:5000` in a web browser of your choice
