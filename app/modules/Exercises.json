The incline bench position increases the stretch on the long head of the biceps, while the neutral grip increases emphasis on the brachioradialis and brachialis. But the \"hammer\" takes some of the tension away from the long head, negating the benefit you gain from sitting at an incline.  Test this yourself by simply placing your right hand on your left biceps. Move your left hand from palm up to palm sideways and you can feel the tension change in your biceps."

Khi ngồi vào chúng ta vẫn phải chỉnh ghế sao cho vừa vặn , khi kéo xuống chúng ta cố gắng kéo sao cho 2 tay cầm ra xa nhau một tí, về cách hít thở thì cũng như vậy, khi bắt đầu dùng lực thì vẫn hít vào và khi kết thúc lực sẽ thở ra.
